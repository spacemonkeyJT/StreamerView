# StreamerView

This is a simple web app designed primarily to allow streamers to create and view a list of Twitch channels, e.g. to keep track of raid suggestions without actually following the channels, to help with choosing a raid target at the end of stream. The site lets you manage a list of channels which are shown as thumbnails of the streams with details such as their name, what they're playing, how long they've been live, view count, bio, etc.

It's currently hosted here: https://streamerview.onrender.com/

Feel free to try it out and raise issues if you have any feedback <3
